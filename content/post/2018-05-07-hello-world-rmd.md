I'm excited to set up my new blog! I plan to post stuff I'm learning that I find cool. Some topics I have in mind are functional programming, becoming more proficient in Python, and reading [Mostly Harmless Economics](http://www.mostlyharmlesseconometrics.com/)

I give special thanks to ...

1. [Yihue Xi](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/) for the excellent Blogdown package, 

2. [Nan Xiao](https://github.com/road2stat/hugo-tanka) for the cool looking Hugo theme, and

3. [Tyler Clavelle](https://tclavelle.github.io/blog/blogdown_github/) for the walkthrough helping me to set up my blog.

See you soon!
